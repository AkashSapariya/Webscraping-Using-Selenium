Even though this has much inferior chipset and \"only\" 512 MB RAM the UI is butter smooth and there is no stuttering or lag anywhere.The display is on the smaller side at 3.5\" but very accurate and thanks to the 326PPI density, it looks super sharp.

Would have liked it to be a bit lighter; but I am not complaining.I think its the best phone for this screen size.Don,t know why people are switching over to bigger phones; It defeats the purpose of being a mobile phone.I remember the good old days when Moto Razr was a charm!!.Though i know people like me are few.But those days will be back I am Sure; where smaller and sleeker was the rage.Bottomline....

The usual guy who delivers it to me walked up my steps three days well ahead of the delivery time. I was very happy to have the product in hand. The first thing I did was to go to a authorised I store (to get my product authenticated) and the reply I got was just bliss. they told the product has moved out of their manufacturing facility in china only on 26th february. I was shell shocked. such a new product on my hands was once so told had been discontinued? On returning back home I noticed the cover of my phone which showed the photo of ios 8 operating system on the cover which then stuck me that it should have been a recent product. I also authenticated my accessories and they were told to be original. Now I am using this phone for the past 10 days and it has been awesome.  I've listed out my experience. pro's: 1. Quality of the material used2. cheaper than other expensive plastic handsets3. ease of use and multi tasking4. internet usage and console level graphics performance5. No much charge consumed only if internet in used (without internet gaming and maps location, facebook and other apps consume less charge). con's: 1. drinks charge like anything on playing games2. gets heated often ( I use a armour guard so I don't feel the heat much)3. storage size is less with 8.1 ( only 5.8gb is available for user)4. gets slow with 8.3 ios ( never hangs it just gets slow with usage and internet speed and others remain same) Yes still its great . . .its good. . .I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy this product.I thank the seller to have dispatched the most virgin piece to meREAD MORE\",),\n",

I am no apple fan boy and always used Nokias and androids but trust me guys even though iPhone 4S is a three generation old phone with the recent announcement of iPhone 6 but it still holds its charm, looks very premium. In terms of everyday performance it is definitely fluid and on par with current generation phones. I had a Sony Xperia Z1(later sold out) with 21 Mp camera besides this phone. After getting iPhone 4S I use to avoid using my Z1 which seemed to be so huge and bulky and definitely not faster UI than my iPhone 4S. Even the camera on Z1 was slower than iPhone 4S. Also transferring data to/from my iphone 4S does not seem to be such a problem as others have made a hype of it. And ofcourse who uses bluetooth nowadays to transfer data after the introduction of whatsapp.8 GB memory and a small screen of 3.5\" does seem to be a bit of limitation but not a deal breaker, at least not for me. Playing 3D games will indeed remind you of the age of he phone. Game play is somewhat jerky. The camera is fast and good. As a moderate user its definitely worth it. Prefer buying it to those cheap looking plastic and laggy android phones in this price range. However, if you are a mainstream heavy user and can stretch your budget get an iphone 5s or 6. Avoid updating iPhone 4S to iOS 8 as it does take a performance hit. I have not updated mine but user experiences on various websites say so.READ MORE',),\n",

       " ('Apple products are classy. I have been using an iPod and an iPad Mini for over an year and am really happy with the devices. But the phone 4s is not worth it.4s is one of the outdtaed apple devices being sold in 3rd world countries to the junta who are crazy about the brand but cannot afford the pricier models (no offence intended, i am a part of the group). But before jumping the bandwagon, take a look at the specs. The A5 processor is outdated, the device UI is laggy most of the times. The update to iOS 8 makes the matter worse hogging your battery and eating up the limited internal memory. Camera is the only saving grace of the device - and it is light years away from a DSLR quality picture.iOS comes with its own restrictions - no bluetooth connectivity to handsfree devices. even transferring file to apple devices using bluetooth is not possible.worthwhile apps and games are usually paid and cost a premiumno file managerdevices with older processors are unable to handle newer iOS versions - suffer both in terms of performance and available spaceMy experience with iTunes has been painful - transferring apps to the devices through the software is a task in itself. You have to transfer individual files to the individual apps you plan to use. No file manager (due to the world class security apple provides). Moreover the customization options are fairly limited. Internal memory of 8GB looks good on paper - is be a seriously limiting factor for many people. No USB-OTG support.And finally the price tag is unjustified for an outdated device. 20k will get you awesome phones by Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry and even Xiaomi. Android and Blackberry OS are years ahead of iOS and offer great features.and devices.My review is based on personal experience and people may tend to disagree. A hands on various devices in this price range would give you a better feel and idea. And i feel that is the best way to decide what phone to buy.Hope the review was helpful.READ MORE',),\n",

       " (\"Having used an Android phone for more than 3 years, I have been pretty impressed with its battle against Apple. Android as a software is independent and companies can make their own smartphones which would be powered by Android.              I was looking for a new phone and had narrowed down my search to three phones - Nexus 5, HTC Desire 616 and iPhone 4S. Almost till the end, I had zeroed down to the Nexus 5. But at the last moment, I decided to take a serious look at my 'requirements'. These were:1. A really nice, bright display2. Graphics which can handle HD games3. Smooth user interface4. Adequate memory5. Affordable price tagI had a hands-on on various High end Android devices and none of them could match up to the first three requirements. And then, I decided to go for the iPhone 4S because it was fulfilling all my requirements except the second last. Going for a higher memory device would have increased the price and made the phone out of budget.So what have I learnt? That don't go on specs like quad core, octa core, 20 megapixel, ppi, huge storage, etc.All these numbers are only to fool us. They have no meaning. All the highest specifications of a high end Android Phone cannot match to a three generation old iPhone.But iPhone has its limitations. It is not customizable. It is very rigid. We have to use it the way it has been shipped. It may not boast of all the tall numbers simply because it is not concerned with them. Rather, it is actually concerned with performance which it delivers.I would extra-polate and say that Apple products should not be compared for specifications. Rather, they should be compared on the grounds of performance and user-experience which is unmatchable.READ MORE\",),\n",

I guess it's high time that I wrote a review being a constant flipkart customerI had purchased an Iphone 4 initially but quickly sold it for an Iphone 4S after I watched the Apple Keynote (launch) in 2011 when I understood that the Iphone 4S was leaps and bounds ahead of Iphone 4. Any Iphone is the best in class for it's touch interface, design quality and such things. So I would not elaborate on those trivial things which Apple innovated back in 2007 which some companies still struggle with, but I would rather talk about what specifically influenced my purchase decision for Iphone 4S. Here are the reasons for my purchase decision:- Speed - 2x faster that Iphone 4 with a Dual Core A5 chip- Graphics - 7 times faster graphics processor compared to Iphone 4- Camera - This was the phone that changed Cellphone Camera's forever. The first phone which was a replacement for a point and shoot camera. When launched it never competed with a cell phone camera, but it competed with point and shoots. Try taking a close-up portrait picture in good daylight and you can even see the texture of the skin of your subject in absolute clarity. Low light photos are average but better with flash. At night always take pics under good lighting - OS Updates - When launched it came with ios 5 and now I it's already on ios 7.1.1. IOS 7 completely changed the experience and made it feel as if you got a new phone with the radical change in the user interface and features. Iphone 4S will get one more update which is ios 8. That's a total of 3 major OS updates which you can not even dream on an Android device. Compare this to Poor Galaxy S3 users where S3 was Samsung's 2012 flagship phone and it did not even get the Android Kitkat 4.4 update of 2013 in most markets, which means Samsung abandons it's users within a year even as you spend 40+ K. Apple gives you major OS updates for 3 more years after a phone launch-Siri - The personal assistant.  This was the most exciting feature of iphone 4S. This would only matter to Indians who can speak English clearly with a US touch. If you can do it then Siri can do a lot of stuff for you. Check Youtube.8 GB is a tad less but at the current price it's a steal deal for a very capable Iphone.READ MORE\",),\n",

No doubt they have hardware, quality best in industry like brilliant Retina display, consistent smoother performance, crispy animated navigation. But lack basics functionality that we use in general tasks. Let's say if I want to check date of today, I can't on top of the notification bar that shows time only, I must go to Calendar to see them where as normal Android phones do the job, ridiculous. In Photo album, there is not way at all to have information about photo/video like date taken, its size etc. Like Android, you can't directly share photo/video to WhatsApp/Viber right from image gallery, you must copy photo/video and paste in WhatsApp/Viber or go to those app and locate photo/video. Apart from that, touchscreen is not as soft as Galaxy or Nexus, you need to touch or swipe hard to do anything on first attempt. I would say, instead of going for a phone of 2011 generation, it's far better to go for latest Nexus 5 at the same price with bigger screen, NFC, 16 GB and expandable, wireless charging and lot more new functionality and features.READ MORE\",),\n",
